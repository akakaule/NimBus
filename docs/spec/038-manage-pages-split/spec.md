# Spec 038 — Split Admin into Operations, Topology and Settings

| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | Approved 2026-10-07 (option B). Slice 1 in progress; slices 2–4 not started. §13's open decisions take the proposed defaults unless the repo owner says otherwise. |
| **Date** | 2026-10-07 |
| **Baseline** | master `0f3b02ef` |
| **Mockup** | [mockup.html](mockup.html). Open it in a browser. The yellow **Design notes** cite the sections below. The **Mock state** bar switches between the states in §7.3. [alternative-a.html](alternative-a.html) is the rejected alternative in §15. |
| **Scope** | `NimBus.WebApp/ClientApp` only: routes, sidebar, three new pages, a settings drawer, and moving the existing `components/admin/*` into them. No API, storage or authorization changes. A few user-facing strings in `NimBus.WebApp` and `NimBus.AppHost` that name "Admin → …" are reworded (§12.2). |

The Admin page has grown to eight tabs, nine on Cosmos DB. They mix three unrelated jobs: acting on messages, inspecting the Service Bus namespace, and switching optional features on and off. This spec removes the Admin page. Its content moves to three pages in the sidebar's **Manage** group, one per job:

- **Operations** (`/Operations`): the endpoint kill switch and every bulk message operation.
- **Topology** (`/Topology`): Service Bus subscriptions, catalog drift, AsyncAPI export and Cosmos DB containers.
- **Settings** (`/Settings`): one row per optional feature with its live state. Each feature is configured in a side panel.

---

## 1. Problems with today's Admin page

1. **Too many tabs, all treated the same.** `pages/admin.tsx:24-34` renders Topology, Operations, Subscriptions, Health, Storage (Cosmos only), Failure intelligence, Simulation, Audit and MCP access as equal-width tabs. The tab strip already fills the content width at 1440 px. The next feature has nowhere to go.
2. **Unrelated jobs side by side.** A Danger-zone delete sits one tab away from a read-only AsyncAPI export and an AI-provider API key.
3. **No URLs.** Tabs are selected by index (`<Tab index={5}>`). A tab cannot be linked or bookmarked, and a refresh always returns to Topology. Runbooks have to say "open Admin, click the sixth tab". `failure-intelligence-settings.tsx:117` works around this with a hard-coded `← Back to Admin` link on phones.
4. **The wrong default.** Topology is tab 0, so an operator who opens Admin during an incident lands on a catalog export.
5. **The kill switch is buried.** The endpoint kill switch is the fourth accordion group inside the Operations tab (`components/admin/operations.tsx`), below eight bulk-operation forms.
6. **Feature state is invisible.** You cannot tell whether MCP access, Failure intelligence or Simulation is on without opening each tab.
7. **Health mixes two things.** `components/admin/health.tsx` holds *Platform services* (live status) and *Heartbeat* configuration: which endpoints are probed, the interval and timeout, and "Send now" (`heartbeat-card.tsx:305-321`). The live heartbeat view is already its own page, `/Heartbeat`.

## 2. Facts this design relies on

All verified against the baseline:

- **Access.** Admin is shown only to site Owners (`components/sidebar.tsx:308`). Every `/api/admin/*` operation checks `IsSiteOwnerAsync()` on the server (`Controllers/ApiContract/AdminImplementation.cs`). The same gate applies to the new pages, and the server remains authoritative.
- **The settings components have different save rules.** A shared drawer must not flatten them (§8.3):

  | Feature | When it applies | Extra confirmation |
  |---|---|---|
  | MCP access | Every instance within 30 s, no restart | Review lists *widens/narrows*; a widening change needs `confirmWidening` |
  | Failure intelligence | Saves a shared revision; needs a restart of every instance | Payload consent checkbox; the API key is write-only |
  | Simulation | At once, but only on this instance; resets on restart | Taking ownership of an endpoint has its own confirmation |
  | Audit logging | At once | Discard / Save |
  | Heartbeat probing | On the next probe | No review step today |
- **Drawer component.** `components/ui/side-panel.tsx` already provides a right-anchored dialog with a focus trap, Escape and backdrop close, and focus return. `pages/failed-messages.tsx` uses it.
- **Sidebar badge data.** The sidebar already polls `getEndpointStatusCountAll` for the Failed badge (`sidebar.tsx`, `useFailedBacklog`). Each row carries `subscriptionStatus`. `null` means unknown (`EndpointImplementation.cs:939-970`). *Send* status is not in that payload; it needs a per-endpoint `getEndpointSendstatus` call.
- **Command palette.** It indexes four kinds of result: `endpoint`, `eventType`, `event` and `session` (`components/command-palette/use-palette-search.ts:17`). It has no page or setting entries.
- **Nothing outside the WebApp navigates to `/Admin`.** No Playwright suite under `samples/` does.

## 3. Goals

- Each page answers one question. Operations: *what do I do about this now?* Topology: *what does the namespace look like?* Settings: *what is switched on, and how is it set up?*
- Every view, operation and setting has a URL.
- Every optional feature's state is visible without opening it.
- Adding a feature adds a Settings row, not a tab.
- Reuse today's components: move them, don't rewrite them. AGENTS.md asks for the WebApp to be enhanced incrementally.

## 4. Non-goals

- No new APIs or authorization model. Endpoint Owners still cannot use these pages (§13, open decision 3).
- No change to any feature's settings semantics, validation or storage.
- No redesign of the forms inside each operation card. They move as they are.
- Access Control and Simulate stay where they are.

## 5. Information architecture

### 5.1 Sidebar

```
MANAGE
  ↻ Operations     [1 paused]   ← site Owner
  ◇ Topology                    ← site Owner
  ⚙ Settings                    ← site Owner
  ▷ Simulate       [running]    ← unchanged: shown only when simulation is allowed and enabled
  ⊡ Access Control              ← unchanged
```

The **Operations** badge counts endpoints whose `subscriptionStatus` reports receive disabled. The data comes from the status-count call the sidebar already makes, so it costs nothing extra. `null` (unknown) never counts. Send-disabled endpoints are not counted, because send status would need N extra calls on every poll. The Operations page shows them (§6.2).

The Manage group grows from three items to five for site Owners: Admin is replaced by three pages. Observe has eight items, so this stays within the sidebar's current length. Collapsing the Manage group is a possible follow-up (§13).

### 5.2 Routes

| Route | View |
|---|---|
| `/Operations` | Operations page, default operation `resubmit` |
| `/Operations/:operation?endpoint=:id` | Operations page with that operation selected and its endpoint pre-filled |
| `/Topology` → `/Topology/subscriptions` | Subscriptions view |
| `/Topology/drift` | Catalog drift (today's Topology audit) |
| `/Topology/storage` | Cosmos DB containers; the route and segment exist only when the provider is Cosmos DB |
| `/Settings` | Settings list |
| `/Settings/:feature?tab=:tab` | Settings list with that feature's drawer open on that tab |
| `/Admin` | Redirects to `/Operations` (§12.1) |

`:operation` ∈ `resubmit, skip, session, stale, dlq, status, to, single, purge, copy, all`.
`:feature` ∈ `mcp, failure-intelligence, heartbeat, simulation, audit`. (The mockup uses short ids.)

### 5.3 Where each part of today's Admin page goes

| Today (tab → section) | New home |
|---|---|
| Topology → Catalog export | Topology page header: **Export AsyncAPI ▾** (YAML / JSON) |
| Topology → Topology audit | Topology → **Catalog drift** |
| Subscriptions | Topology → **Subscriptions** |
| Storage (Cosmos only) | Topology → **Storage** (Cosmos only) |
| Operations → Recovery / Cleanup / Infrastructure | Operations → operation list (§6.3) |
| Operations → Endpoint kill switch | Operations → **Endpoints** table (§6.2) |
| Operations → Danger zone | Operations → operation list, **Irreversible** group |
| Health → Platform services | **Heartbeat** page, site Owners only (§9.1) |
| Health → Heartbeat configuration | Settings → **Heartbeat probing** |
| Failure intelligence | Settings → AI & agents |
| MCP access | Settings → AI & agents |
| Simulation | Settings → Testing |
| Audit | Settings → Compliance |

## 6. Operations page

### 6.1 Status strip

There are four tiles. Each one is also a shortcut:

| Tile | Value | Click |
|---|---|---|
| Failed | Sum of failed counts across endpoints | `/Operations/resubmit` |
| Dead-lettered | Sum of dead-letter counts | `/Operations/dlq` |
| Endpoints paused | Endpoints with receive or send off | Filters the Endpoints table to *Needs attention* |
| Pending | Sum of pending counts | `/Operations/stale` |

All values come from `getEndpointStatusCountAll`, except the paused count, which also uses the send status loaded for §6.2.

### 6.2 Endpoints table

This replaces `EndpointControlsCard` and is the first thing on the page, because it is what an operator reaches for in an incident.

- **Columns:** Endpoint, Receive (toggle), Send (toggle), Failed, Dead-letter, Pending, and row actions.
- **Toggles** call the same APIs as today (`postEndpointSubscriptionstatus`, `postEndpointSendstatus`) and keep today's confirmation. Pausing *send* shows the existing quarantine warning: events forwarded in dead-letter at the source. A paused receive shows how long it has been paused, if the metadata records the time. Otherwise it shows "paused".
- **Row actions:** *Resubmit…* (shown when failed or dead-lettered is above zero) and *⋯* for the other operations. Each one navigates to `/Operations/:operation?endpoint=:id`, which pre-fills that endpoint.
- **Filtering:** a text box plus a **Needs attention** chip. The chip shows only endpoints with a pause, a failure or a dead letter. Endpoints that need attention get a warning-coloured stripe on the left.

### 6.3 Operation list and detail

The list is grouped by blast radius, keeping today's colours and captions:

| Group | Operations | Caption |
|---|---|---|
| Recovery (green) | Bulk resubmit failed · Skip messages · Session purge · Reconcile stale pending | safe · reversible |
| Cleanup (amber) | Delete dead-lettered · Delete by status · Delete by To field · Delete single event | not replayed |
| Data movement (blue) | Purge subscription · Copy endpoint data | cross-environment |
| Irreversible (red) | Delete all events | audit-logged |

"Infrastructure" is renamed **Data movement**, because subscription *management* moved to Topology. Only one operation's form is shown at a time. The detail pane renders today's card components (`BulkResubmitCard`, `SkipMessagesCard`, …) unchanged, apart from accepting an `initialEndpoint` prop. Below 900 px the list collapses into a select above the detail pane.

### 6.4 Safety rules (unchanged)

- Every operation previews its scope before it runs, as the cards already do.
- **Every** operation keeps today's typed confirmation (`ConfirmDestructiveAction`). That includes the Recovery group: resubmit, skip and reconcile confirm with the endpoint name, Session purge with its own text, and Delete by To field with the To value. The confirmation states the count and what happens next. Only the button colour follows the group: primary for Recovery, red otherwise.
- Progress uses the existing `OperationProgress`. The result links to the Audit Log.

## 7. Settings page

### 7.1 Rows

A small registry (`settings/feature-registry.ts`) describes each feature: id, group, icon, name, one-line description, keyword index, a status hook, a summary hook, a quick action, and its drawer tabs. The list renders from that registry. Adding a feature means adding one registry entry and one drawer component.

| Group | Feature | Status (example) | Summary (example) | Quick action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AI & agents | MCP access | ● Serving / ○ Off / Not deployed | 2 actions · 0 refused · 24 h | **Turn off now** (when serving) |
| AI & agents | Failure intelligence | ● On / ○ Off / Restart required | No API key configured | **Set up…** → drawer |
| Monitoring | Heartbeat probing | ● On | 8 of 12 endpoints · every 5 min | **Send now** |
| Testing | Simulation | ● On / ○ Off / Blocked in production | Allowed in dev · auto-stop 30 min | **Enable…** → drawer / **Open Simulate** |
| Compliance | Audit logging | 14 of 16 recorded | Access-denied and settings changes always recorded | — |

Status and summary reuse the data each settings component already loads. Examples: MCP's `/api/admin/mcp/activity`, Failure intelligence's `state.active` and `restartRequired`, and Simulation's `useSimulationStatus`. The Settings page loads these summaries itself. It does not mount every drawer.

### 7.2 The quick-action rule

A row may act **inline only** when the action narrows access *and* applies at once with no consent, key or restart:

- **Allowed inline:** MCP **Turn off now**, which calls `/api/admin/mcp/turn-off` behind today's confirmation; Heartbeat **Send now**; Simulation **Open Simulate**.
- **Opens the drawer instead:** anything that widens access, needs a key or consent, or needs a restart. For example: MCP *Turn on…* opens Overview, Failure intelligence *Set up…* opens Activation & provider, and Simulation *Enable…* opens Simulate mode.

The first mockup (Alternative B v1) put plain on/off toggles on each row. That would have bypassed MCP's widening confirmation and Failure intelligence's key and consent checks, so this spec drops them.

### 7.3 States

Each state comes from data the component already exposes. The mockup's **Mock state** bar shows them.

| State | Row | Drawer |
|---|---|---|
| MCP not deployed (`available` false) | Badge "Not deployed"; no quick action | Info banner. The Serve toggle is disabled, as today. |
| Failure intelligence restart pending (`restartRequired`) | Amber "Restart required"; counted by the *Needs attention* chip | Warning banner, as today |
| Failure intelligence key missing | "No API key configured" | Info banner pointing to the Provider tab |
| Failure intelligence key unreadable (`savedApiKey === "unreadable"`) | Red "Key unreadable" | Today's alert |
| Simulation blocked (`allowed` false) | Red "Blocked in production"; no quick action | Danger banner; controls read-only |

### 7.4 Filter

- **Chips:** All / On / Off / Needs attention. *Needs attention* means a warning or danger status.
- **Text filter:** matches name, description and the registry's keyword index, which lists the labels inside each drawer. So "payload" finds MCP access *and* Failure intelligence, and "rate" finds MCP Limits and Simulation's rate ceiling.

## 8. Settings drawer

### 8.1 Anatomy

The drawer is `SidePanel`, about 880 px wide, and full-screen below 820 px. The full-screen layout replaces Failure intelligence's own `max-sm:fixed` overlay and its `← Back to Admin` link.

```
┌ header ───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Title  [status badge]          [quick action]   [✕]  │
│ revision / applies-when line (mono, muted)            │
│ one-paragraph lead                                    │
│ Tab · Tab • · Tab · Tab        (• = unsaved changes)  │
├ body (scrolls) ───────────────────────────────────────┤
│ state banner (§7.3), then the tab's cards             │
├ footer (sticky) ──────────────────────────────────────┤
│ "2 unsaved changes · 1 widens access"  [Discard] [Review & save] │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 8.2 Tabs for each feature

Each tab maps to today's numbered cards. The `01 · …` prefixes go away, because the tabs carry the order.

| Feature | Tabs (source) |
|---|---|
| MCP access | Overview (KPI tiles + 01 Activation) · Permissions (02 + *Effective access* preview beside it) · Who & where (03) · Limits (04) · Connect · Activity |
| Failure intelligence | Activation & provider (01) · Evidence (02 + *What leaves NimBus* preview beside it) · Scope & guardrails (03) · How failures are classified (04) |
| Heartbeat probing | Probing (interval, timeout, Send now) · Endpoints (include/exclude) |
| Simulation | Simulate mode (01) · Consuming endpoints (02) · Environment policy |
| Audit logging | Action types |

The previews (*Effective access*, *What leaves NimBus*) stay on the same tab as the controls they explain, and they preview the **draft**.

### 8.3 Save and review

The drawer owns one draft for each open feature. Tabs edit the same draft, so switching tabs keeps your edits. The footer counts changed fields. **Review & save** replaces the body with a review screen:

- Each change is listed with a **widens / narrows / changes** chip. Today only MCP classifies changes like this; the other features show *changes*.
- Feature-specific confirmations are kept: MCP's widening checkbox, and Failure intelligence's payload-consent checkbox. **Save** stays disabled until they are ticked.
- The footer states when the change takes effect, as in §2: "Applies within 30 s", "Restart required after saving", and so on.

Under the hood, each feature's existing `save()` is called unchanged. The drawer standardises the frame around the components, not their logic. Heartbeat probing gains a review step it doesn't have today. Because it is just as cheap, Audit gets the same frame.

### 8.4 Unsaved changes

Closing the drawer with a non-empty draft asks "Discard N unsaved changes?" and lists them. Closing means ✕, Escape, a backdrop click, the browser back button, or any navigation. The question shows *Keep editing* and *Discard*. The same check runs when you switch to another feature's drawer.

### 8.5 URLs and history

Opening a drawer pushes `/Settings/:feature?tab=:tab`. Switching tabs *replaces* the entry, so Back closes the drawer instead of stepping through tabs. A deep link opens the drawer over the list.

## 9. Changes to other pages

### 9.1 Heartbeat

- A **Platform services** card (today's `PlatformServicesCard`) sits above the fleet table. It is rendered only for site Owners, because `/api/admin/health/services` checks for an Owner. Everyone else sees the page exactly as today.
- A header action **⚙ Configure probing** links to `/Settings/heartbeat`. It is shown only to site Owners.

### 9.2 Simulate

The header gains **⚙ Simulation settings**, linking to `/Settings/simulation`.

### 9.3 Audit Log

The header gains **⚙ Configure recording**, linking to `/Settings/audit`. It is shown only to site Owners.

## 10. Command palette

Add a `page` kind and a `setting` kind to `use-palette-search.ts`. Both are client-side and static, and shown only to site Owners:

- The three pages.
- Each operation, for example "Bulk resubmit failed · Operations".
- Each feature and each drawer tab, with the registry's keyword index for each tab. "rate" finds *MCP access › Limits* and *Simulation › Simulate mode*.
- Each endpoint's controls ("erp-adapter — endpoint controls" → `/Operations?endpoint=erp-adapter`).
- The topology views.

## 11. Accessibility and responsiveness

- **Tabs:** the drawer tabs use the existing `components/ui/tabs`. The segmented controls on Topology use `role="tablist"`.
- **Toggles:** every toggle in the Endpoints table has an accessible name, such as "Receive erp-adapter".
- **Drawer:** focus handling comes from `SidePanel`, unchanged.
- **Colour:** status colour is never the only signal. Badges carry text, and attention rows have a text cue as well as the stripe.
- **At 820 px and below:**
  - the drawer is full-screen;
  - the operation list becomes a select;
  - tables scroll horizontally inside their card;
  - each Settings row drops its summary, and its quick action wraps under the title.

## 12. Compatibility

### 12.1 Redirect

`/Admin` (any case) redirects to `/Operations` with `replace`. Old tabs had no URLs, so there is nothing finer to map. Keep the redirect for at least one minor release, and drop it in the next major alongside other `[Obsolete]` removals (`docs/versioning.md`).

### 12.2 Strings and docs that name "Admin → …"

The user-facing ones change in the same PR:

- `Services/Simulation/SimulationService.cs:574, :630`. Reword to "… in Settings → Simulation". No test asserts these texts; only doc comments and a `describe` name mention them (`SimulationApiTests.cs:19`, `simulation-settings.test.tsx:37`), and those are renamed too.
- `ClientApp/src/components/simulate/scenario-bar.tsx:39` and `subscribers-card.tsx:34`.
- `Services/SubscriptionAdminService.cs:598`: "Remove it from Topology → Catalog drift".
- `NimBus.AppHost/Program.cs:178` (startup log line).

The XML doc comments that say "Admin → X API" (`SimulationImplementation.cs:16`, `McpAccessImplementation.cs:17`, …) are reworded where convenient. The `/api/admin/*` routes do **not** change.

24 files under `docs/` mention "Admin → …", 46 times in all. Update the current guides: `features.md`, `heartbeat.md`, `mcp-server.md`, `integration-intelligence.md`, `webapp-simulate.md`, `service-bus-subscription-admin.md`, `storage-providers.md`, `rate-limiting.md`, `asyncapi-mapping.md`, `message-flows.md`, `webapp-rest-api.md`, `sdk-api-reference.md`, `samples/DynamicsBcDemo/README.md` and `talk-track.md`. Leave historical specs, plans and ADRs as they are.

## 13. Open decisions for the repo owner

1. **Where `/Admin` redirects.** `/Operations` (proposed: the incident path) or `/Settings`.
2. **Where Storage lives.** Under Topology (proposed: it is infrastructure) or Settings.
3. **Endpoint Owners on Operations.** An endpoint Owner could get a version of Operations scoped to their own endpoints. That needs server-side authorization by endpoint on the bulk APIs, which are Owner-only today. Out of scope here; worth a follow-up spec.
4. **Collapsing the Manage group.** The sidebar grows by two items for site Owners. Options: accept it (proposed), or make Manage collapsible, remembered per viewer.
5. **The sidebar badge for send-paused endpoints.** Accept the receive-only count (proposed), or add `sendStatus` to `EndpointStatusCount` so one call covers both. That is an API-spec change.

## 14. Implementation slices

Each slice is a separate PR, shippable on its own, with screenshots as AGENTS.md requires.

| Slice | Contents | Risk |
|---|---|---|
| **1. Routes and pages** | `pages/operations.tsx`, `pages/topology.tsx`, `pages/settings.tsx`. Each composes today's components with no visual redesign: Operations = kill switch + the existing accordions; Topology = Subscriptions + audit + export + storage behind a segmented control; Settings = a simple list where each row opens its existing component in `SidePanel`. Add the sidebar items, the route table in `app.tsx`, the `topbar.tsx` breadcrumbs and the `/Admin` redirect, and remove `pages/admin.tsx`. Because the Health tab disappears, Platform services moves to the Heartbeat page (site Owners only, §9.1) in this slice. Failure intelligence drops its phone-only full-screen overlay and `← Back to Admin` link, which would fight the panel. The strings and the docs sweep in §12.2 also land here, so no release ships navigation that its docs no longer describe. | Low. Moves code; logic is unchanged. |
| **2. Settings list and drawer** | Feature registry, row status and summary, the quick-action rule, states, filter, the drawer frame (tabs, sticky footer, review screen, unsaved-changes guard, URL handling), and splitting each settings component's cards into tab sections. | Medium. It touches five settings components; their tests must stay green. |
| **3. Operations redesign** | Status strip, Endpoints table (merging kill switch and counts), master/detail operation list, `initialEndpoint` pre-fill, deep links, the sidebar *paused* badge. | Medium |
| **4. Cross-links and palette** | The ⚙ links on Simulate, Audit Log and Heartbeat, and the palette's `page` and `setting` kinds. | Low |

## 15. Alternatives considered

- **A: keep Admin and give it a grouped sub-navigation** ([alternative-a.html](alternative-a.html)). Admin stays as one page with a left sub-navigation (Operate / Topology / Features), an Overview landing page, and a URL for each section. It is cheaper (mostly `admin.tsx` plus routes) and leaves the sidebar alone. It was rejected because it keeps three different jobs behind one navigation entry and adds a second level of navigation. The repo owner preferred B.
- **Keep the tabs and add an overflow menu.** This hides tabs instead of organising them, and it fixes neither the URL problem nor the invisible feature state.
- **One Settings page that also absorbs Operations and Topology.** "Settings" is the wrong mental model for deleting dead letters. It would bring back the problem in §1.2.

## 16. Testing

- **Unit tests (Vitest):**
  - Replace `pages/admin.test.tsx` with `operations.test.tsx`, `topology.test.tsx` and `settings.test.tsx`.
  - Cover route deep links, including `?endpoint=` pre-fill and `?tab=`.
  - Cover the `/Admin` redirect.
  - Cover the unsaved-changes guard on close, Escape and route change.
  - Cover the quick-action rule: no inline widening.
  - Cover the review screen's required confirmations.
  - Cover the Storage segment rendering only on Cosmos DB.
- **Sidebar tests:** three items for site Owners; none for others, or Access Control only for endpoint Owners. The paused badge treats `null` `subscriptionStatus` as unknown.
- **Existing component tests:** must pass unchanged in slice 1. In slice 2, any change to them must be explained in the PR.
- **Manual checks:** 1440 px and 375 px, light and dark, with screenshots in each PR.

Commands: `npm --prefix src/NimBus.WebApp/ClientApp run test:ci`, `npm --prefix src/NimBus.WebApp/ClientApp run build`, `dotnet build src/NimBus.sln -c Release` (for the C# string changes).
