# NimBus operator MCP server

The management WebApp can serve a **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** endpoint at `/mcp`. It lets an
AI agent (Claude Code, Claude Desktop or any MCP client) look at endpoint health, find and inspect
messages, search across endpoints, read metrics and failure classifications, and, for a signed-in
operator, resubmit, skip, mark reported and classify failed messages. It applies the same
authorization, redaction and audit as the Web UI.

- **Transport:** Streamable HTTP, stateless, protocol revisions up to 2026-07-28
  (`ModelContextProtocol.AspNetCore`).
- **Access:** read tools for every caller with the observe permission. Tools that change a message
  are for interactive, delegated callers only (see [Changing messages](#changing-messages)). There
  are no administrative tools.
- **Design:** [Spec 035](spec/035-mcp-operator-access/spec.md).

The endpoint is off unless it is enabled. It replaces the earlier stdio server `NimBus.Mcp`
(see [Migrating from NimBus.Mcp](#migrating-from-nimbusmcp)).

## Tools

| Tool | Returns | Needs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `nimbus_get_capabilities` | Environment, caller, readable endpoints, limits and features. Call it first | Signed in |
| `nimbus_list_endpoints` | Readable endpoints with the event types each produces and consumes | Endpoint Reader |
| `nimbus_get_overview` | Counts by status, oldest failure and Monitor acknowledgements across readable endpoints | Endpoint Reader |
| `nimbus_get_endpoint` | The same for one endpoint | Endpoint Reader |
| `nimbus_find_messages` | Tracked messages on one endpoint, filtered by status, event type, session, event id and time | Endpoint Reader |
| `nimbus_get_message` | Status, latest attempt, latest error, Web UI link, `messageVersion` and the `eligibleActions` you may take; the payload only with `includePayload=true` | Endpoint Reader; payloads also need PiiReader (and, with Entra, the `nimbus.payload.read` scope) |
| `nimbus_get_message_history` | Processing attempts and log entries of one message | Endpoint Reader |
| `nimbus_get_session` | Pending and deferred events of one session | Endpoint Reader |
| `nimbus_search_messages` | Processing messages across all endpoints | Site Reader |
| `nimbus_get_metrics` | Throughput, latency or failure groups for 1h to 30d | Site Reader |
| `nimbus_get_classification` | The stored AI classification of a failed attempt, advisory only | Endpoint Reader; classification enabled |
| `nimbus_prepare_action` | A read-only preview of resubmitting or skipping one message, and an `actionToken` to run it | The action's scope and endpoint Contributor |
| `nimbus_resubmit_message` | Runs a prepared resubmit: replays the latest stored payload to the endpoint | `nimbus.resubmit` and endpoint Contributor |
| `nimbus_skip_message` | Runs a prepared skip: the message is never processed, and later messages in its session may be released | `nimbus.skip` and endpoint Contributor |
| `nimbus_set_message_reported` | Sets or clears the "reported" marker, optionally with an external ticket id | `nimbus.annotate` and endpoint Contributor |
| `nimbus_classify_failure` | Requests an AI classification of a failure, or returns the stored one. Advisory only | `nimbus.classify` and endpoint Contributor; classification enabled |

Results never contain stack traces. Error and log text is cut to 2,000 characters and is untrusted
data from the failing handler. Timestamps are UTC. Errors start with a code in brackets, for example
`[EndpointNotFound]` or `[PermissionDenied]`. A resource the caller cannot read is reported exactly
like one that does not exist.

## Changing messages

Resubmit and skip take two steps, so the user can see what will happen before it does:

1. `nimbus_get_message` returns the message's `messageVersion`, a fingerprint of its status, session,
   latest attempt and update time, and the `eligibleActions` you may take on it.
2. `nimbus_prepare_action` with the action and that version checks your permission and the
   message's state without changing anything. It returns the impact, including how many later
   messages are waiting in the session, and an `actionToken`.
3. `nimbus_resubmit_message` or `nimbus_skip_message` with the token, a reason and a new GUID as
   `idempotencyKey` runs the action.

The token is valid for two minutes, only for the caller, client application and environment it
was issued to, and only for that action on that version of the message. It is a state check, not
proof that a human approved the action: clients should show the preview and ask the user before a
skip. When the tool runs, NimBus:

- re-reads the caller's role from the stored access-control lists, so a grant revoked moments ago
  is honored;
- claims the message at the version in the token, so a second command on the same version, whether
  from the Web UI, another agent or a replayed token, sends nothing and gets `[StaleMessage]`;
- writes the audit row (channel, reason, idempotency key, client application) and refuses the action
  with `[AuditUnavailable]` if it cannot;
- then publishes the command.

The result says the command was sent, not that it succeeded. Read the message again to see the
outcome. A message that failed again has a new version and needs a new token. For the few seconds
between the command and the Resolver recording it, `nimbus_get_message` reports the message as
`[MessageNotFound]`, because the command claims the row by archiving it; read it again a little
later.

Over MCP, resubmit and skip accept Failed, DeadLettered and Unsupported messages. Deferred messages
and pending handoffs are recovered in the Web UI. `nimbus_set_message_reported` and
`nimbus_classify_failure` need no token; they take a reason or an idempotency key directly.

Tools that change a message require a delegated scope from a signed-in user. A workload token,
which carries app roles and no `scp` claim, is refused with `[PermissionDenied]`. Errors specific
to these tools are `[StaleMessage]`, `[ActionNotAllowed]` (the message's state does not allow the
action), `[RateLimited]`, `[AuditUnavailable]` and `[OutcomeUnknown]` (publishing failed after the
message was claimed; it was restored, so read it again before you retry).

## Managing access in the WebApp

A site Owner manages MCP access in **Settings → MCP access** ([Spec 037](spec/037-mcp-admin-access/spec.md)).
There are two layers:

- **The deployment** decides whether `/mcp` can exist and whom NimBus trusts for tokens:
  `NimBus__Mcp__Enabled`, `NimBus__Mcp__EnableForLocalDevelopment`, `NimBus__Mcp__Entra__*`,
  `NimBus__Mcp__AllowedOrigins__*` and the `RateLimiting__Mcp*` limits. The tab shows them but
  cannot change them.
- **The Owner's policy** can only narrow that. A call proceeds only when the policy, the Entra scope
  or app role, the NimBus role on the endpoint and the message state all allow it.

The policy covers:

| Setting | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Serve the MCP endpoint | When off, every call gets `503 [Disabled]`. The protected-resource metadata keeps working. |
| Raw payloads, mark reported, classify, resubmit, skip | A switched-off tool is removed from `tools/list` and from `permittedActions`; a direct call gets `[PermissionDenied] … turned off by an administrator`. The read tools have no switch. |
| Unattended workloads | Whether app-only (`Nimbus.Observe`) tokens are accepted for the read tools. |
| People | Everyone with a NimBus role, or only listed users and groups (email, user object id, or a group object id from the `groups` claim). Workloads are governed by the workload switch instead. |
| Client applications | Any client Entra lets sign in, or only approved ones, matched on `azp` (then `appid`). Each approved client can be allowed or denied the tools that change messages. |
| Endpoints | Hide endpoints from agents (they answer `[EndpointNotFound]`), and limit where agents may change messages. |
| Limits | Lower the request and change limits below the deployment's values. |

Callers refused by the people, client or workload rules get `403`. Refusals are audited as
`McpAccessRefused` (at most one row per caller, client, reason and tool every 5 minutes per
instance); every save is audited as `UpdateMcpSettings` with the list of changes.

Changes apply without a restart: each instance re-reads the policy at most every 30 seconds, and
the instance that saved it applies it at once. **Turn off now** turns the endpoint off on the
latest saved policy, whatever revision the page last read. The policy fails closed: if it cannot
be read, an instance keeps the last policy it loaded, and until it has loaded one at all it
answers `503 [Unavailable]`. With no saved policy, everything the deployment allows is on, as
before the tab existed.

The policy is one record in shared storage (`IEndpointMetadataStore.GetMcpAccessSettings`;
SQL Server migration `0023_McpAccessSettings.sql`, a fixed-id document in the Cosmos settings
container). The API is `GET`/`PUT /api/admin/mcp/settings`, `POST /api/admin/mcp/turn-off` and
`GET /api/admin/mcp/activity`.

## Local development (Aspire)

With the NimBus Aspire AppHost (`src/NimBus.AppHost`) no setup is needed: it sets
`NimBus__Mcp__EnableForLocalDevelopment=true`, and the
WebApp serves `/mcp` whenever its local-dev bypass is on (Development and
`EnableLocalDevAuthentication=true` in `src/NimBus.WebApp/appsettings.Development.json`). The
CrmErpDemo AppHost does not set it; to use `/mcp` there, set `NimBus:Mcp:EnableForLocalDevelopment`
to `true` yourself, for example in that `appsettings.Development.json`. No sign-in
is involved; every call runs as the "Local Developer" user, with the same role and PII checks as the
Web UI. Scopes do not apply in this mode, so the tools that change messages need only the
Contributor role. With the bypass off, `/mcp` is not served.

Point the client at the WebApp's HTTPS URL from the Aspire dashboard (by default
`https://localhost:18443`) plus `/mcp`. For example, an `.mcp.json` entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "nimbus": { "type": "http", "url": "https://localhost:18443/mcp" }
  }
}
```

In this mode the endpoint accepts loopback connections only, and refuses browser requests whose
`Origin` is not a localhost address. This protects against DNS rebinding.

## Azure (Entra ID)

In Azure the endpoint requires an Entra access token issued for its own app registration. It does
not use the WebApp's sign-in registration, cookies or the `"Az"` bearer scheme.

### 1. Register the MCP resource

In the tenant that signs in your operators:

1. Create an app registration, for example `NimBus MCP (dev)`, single tenant. Note its
   **Application (client) ID**.
2. **Expose an API:** keep the default Application ID URI (`api://<client-id>`) or set your own.
   Add these delegated scopes:
   - `nimbus.observe`: use the read tools.
   - `nimbus.payload.read`: see raw event payloads. It only adds to the PiiReader role, and never
     replaces it.
   - `nimbus.resubmit`, `nimbus.skip`, `nimbus.annotate` and `nimbus.classify`: use
     `nimbus_resubmit_message`, `nimbus_skip_message`, `nimbus_set_message_reported` and
     `nimbus_classify_failure`. Each only adds to the Contributor role on the endpoint. Consider
     making them admin-consent scopes so only clients you approve can request them.
3. **Add the endpoint URL as a second Application ID URI:** `https://<webapp>/mcp`, exactly as
   clients connect to it. MCP clients send that URL as the OAuth `resource` parameter, and Entra
   refuses a sign-in whose `resource` does not belong to the same app as the requested scopes
   (`AADSTS9010010: The resource parameter provided in the request doesn't match with the
   requested scopes`). Keep `api://<client-id>` as well: the advertised scopes use it.
   ```bash
   az ad app update --id <client-id> --identifier-uris "api://<client-id>" "https://<webapp>/mcp"
   ```
4. **Manifest:** set `api.requestedAccessTokenVersion` to `2`, so access tokens carry the client
   id as their audience whichever identifier the client asked for.
5. **App roles** (optional, for unattended workloads): add `Nimbus.Observe` for applications. No
   app role grants payload access or changes messages.
6. **Token configuration** (optional): add the `groups` claim if your NimBus role grants use Entra
   groups. Grants keyed by object id or email work without it.
7. **Register an MCP client.** Entra does not support dynamic client registration, so every MCP
   client needs a client id of its own. Do not use the MCP resource's client id from step 1.1 (the
   WebApp shows it as **MCP resource (API) app ID**): it has no redirect URI, so Entra refuses the
   sign-in with `AADSTS500113: No reply address is registered for the application`. For a desktop
   client such as Claude Code, create a second single-tenant app registration, for example
   `NimBus MCP Client (dev)`:
   - **Authentication:** add a **Mobile and desktop** redirect URI on the client's loopback
     callback. For Claude Code that is `http://localhost:<port>/callback`, where `<port>` is the
     port you pass as `--callback-port`; pick any free port, but it must match exactly.
   - Turn on **Allow public client flows**. The client needs no secret.
   - On the MCP resource (**Expose an API → Authorized client applications**), pre-authorize the
     client id for `nimbus.observe`, and for the other scopes only where needed, or grant consent
     for them.

The endpoint accepts v2.0 tokens (issuer `https://login.microsoftonline.com/<tenant>/v2.0`,
audience the client id) and v1.0 tokens (issuer `https://sts.windows.net/<tenant>/`, audience the
Application ID URI).

### 2. Configure the WebApp

Set these app settings on the management WebApp:

| Setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `NimBus__Mcp__Enabled` | `true` |
| `NimBus__Mcp__Entra__TenantId` | Tenant id |
| `NimBus__Mcp__Entra__ClientId` | The MCP resource's client id from step 1.1, not a client from step 1.7 |
| `NimBus__Mcp__Entra__ApplicationIdUri` | Only if you changed it from `api://<client-id>`. The scopes' identifier, not the endpoint URL from step 1.3 |
| `NimBus__Mcp__Entra__Instance` | Only for a sovereign cloud; default `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` |
| `NimBus__Mcp__AllowedOrigins__0` | Only for browser-based MCP clients: their origin |

```bash
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <resource-group> --name <webapp-name> --settings NimBus__Mcp__Enabled=true NimBus__Mcp__Entra__TenantId=<tenant-id> NimBus__Mcp__Entra__ClientId=<client-id>
```

`nb infra apply` keeps every `NimBus__Mcp__*` setting across redeploys. If `NimBus__Mcp__Enabled`
is `true` but the tenant or client id is missing, the WebApp fails to start and names the missing
keys, rather than serving an unauthenticated endpoint.

### 3. Verify

- `GET https://<webapp>/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` returns the resource metadata:
  the authorization server and the six scopes.
- `POST https://<webapp>/mcp` without a token returns `401` with a `WWW-Authenticate` header that
  points at that metadata.
- An MCP client that signs in with the `nimbus.observe` scope can call `nimbus_get_capabilities`.
  For Claude Code, add the server with the client registration from step 1.7 and the port of its
  redirect URI, then run `/mcp` in a `claude` session and authenticate `nimbus` in the browser:

  ```bash
  claude mcp add --transport http --client-id <mcp-client-app-id> --callback-port <port> nimbus https://<webapp>/mcp
  ```

  The WebApp's **Settings → MCP access → Connect** tab shows this command, filled with an approved
  client when the policy approves specific clients.

- With a write scope and Contributor, `nimbus_get_capabilities` lists the action in
  `permittedActions`. After you add a scope to the registration, sign in again so the token
  carries it.

In [private networking mode](spec/034-private-networking/spec.md), only clients inside the network
can reach `/mcp`. Cloud-hosted agents need a path through the Application Gateway.

## Limits

`/mcp` has its own rate-limit policy, `nimbus-mcp`: 60 requests per 60 seconds, per tenant,
client application and user. Tools that change a message are also limited to 5 per 60 seconds
for the same caller (`RateLimiting:McpMutations`), and answer `[RateLimited]` beyond that. A site
Owner can lower both limits in Settings → MCP access, but not raise them. See
[rate limiting](rate-limiting.md).

## Migrating from NimBus.Mcp

`NimBus.Mcp` was a local stdio process that called `/api/agent/*` and identified itself with an
`X-Agent-Id` header. It has been removed.

- **Client configuration:** replace the `mcpServers` entry that ran `dotnet run --project
  src/NimBus.Mcp/...` with the `/mcp` URL above, and drop `NIMBUS_API_BASEURL` and
  `NIMBUS_AGENT_ID`.
- **Replaced tools:** `discover_topology` is now `nimbus_list_endpoints`. `search_failures` is now
  `nimbus_find_messages`, `nimbus_search_messages` and `nimbus_get_message_history`.
- **Bus participation:** `define_event_type`, `subscribe`, `receive_messages`, `publish_event` and
  `settle_message` are not operator tools. Agents that take part on the bus use the `NimBus.Agents`
  REST SDK against `/api/agent/*`.
